TODO: 
1) Edit unit tests so every getter and exception will have it's own unit test.
2) Check all the attributes and 
3) Check if all the tests Pass. one of the tests that do not pass is the one in groups called SaveAndLoadGroups_ShouldPersistDataCorrectly.
4) Made changed in the AccountTests.cs file so that all the tests actually pass. incase the tests dont pass ask chat to explain and figure out the reasoning ig, its pretty helpful.
# This is where we will add out README
